          We collect personal information because it helps us deliver a superior
          level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access
          to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest
          interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep

            There are several situations in which your personal information can
            help us provide better service. For example, we may ask for your
            personal information when you’re discussing a service issue on the
            phone with an associate, downloading a product, registering your
            products, or purchasing a product. At such times, we may collect
            personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name,
            mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact
            preferences; your credit card information; and information about the
            PickBetta products you own, such as invoice numbers and dates of
            purchase. We also collect information regarding customer activities
            on our website and on related websites, which helps us determine how
            best to provide useful information to customers and understand which
            parts of our websites and services are of most interest to them.

            The PickBetta website allows you to create a "User ID" based on your
            personal information. This convenient service saves you time and
            allows for easier use of our web services. Here’s how it works: You
            create a personal profile—providing your name, phone number, email
            address, and in some cases your mailing address or credit card
            number—and choose a password for security. The system saves your
            information and assigns you a personal User ID. The next time you
            order from the PickBetta Store or purchase any of our products, all
            you need to do is enter your User ID and Password; the system looks
            up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you
            update the information associated with your User ID, it will be
            available for all your transactions with PickBetta globally.

            PickBetta takes your privacy very seriously. Be assured that
            PickBetta does not sell or rent your contact information to other
            marketers. To help us provide superior service, your personal

            group globally, who will safeguard it in accordance with PickBetta's
            privacy policy. There are also times when it may be advantageous for

            that perform work for PickBetta to provide products and services to

            manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess
            your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer
